\title{Format Odds Ratio and P-value Together}
\usage{
orp(model, var, or_digits = 2, p_digits = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted model object (typically logistic regression)}

\item{var}{Character string naming the coefficient}

\item{or_digits}{Digits for odds ratio (default: 2)}

\item{p_digits}{Digits for p-value (default: 3)}
}
\value{
Character string in format "OR = X.XX, p = Y.YYY"
}
\description{
Extracts both odds ratio and p-value and formats them as a single string.
Useful for inline reporting of logistic regression results.
}
\examples{
m <- glm(am ~ wt + hp, data = mtcars, family = binomial)
orp(m, "wt")
# Returns: "OR = 0, p = 0.014"

# In R Markdown prose:
# "Weight was associated with lower odds of manual transmission (`r orp(m, 'wt')`)."
}
